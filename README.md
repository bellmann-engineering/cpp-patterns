Hands-On Software Architecture Patterns with C++ by Dr. K. Bellmann and Prof. B. Br√ºgge

Each folder contains sample code for the following design patterns:
- Abstract Factory
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Builder
- Command
- Composite
- Decorator
- MVC
- Observer
- Proxy
- State
- Strategy 

*Note:*
For demonstration purposes some files contain more than one class and others have method definitions in the header file. Please be aware of these things if you plan on using the code samples in a real world project.
